      <p>Upper school students are constantly emailing and communicating with     teachers. In order to avoid any sorts of embarrassment, here’s a set     of rules to follow when writing an email to a teacher.</p>
      <h4 id="subject-lines"><strong>Subject Lines</strong></h4>
      <p>The subject line is one of the most important parts of an email because this is what the teacher first sees. Your subject line needs to catch your reader’s eye and convey the message that it needs to be opened.</p>
      <p><em>Subject lines should</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>relate to what the email is about</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>It gives the reader an idea of what the message is about and if it requires an action</p>
      </blockquote>
      <pre><code>Ex: Absent from class (9/21/19) Requesting Study Hall Pass
      </code></pre>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Subject lines should NOT be…</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><em><strong>BLANK</strong></em></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Never leave a subject line blank because it comes off as unprofessional and the teacher has no idea what to expect in the message!</p>
      </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Your personal information repeated</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>They already know who is sending the message.</p>
      </blockquote>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="salutations"><strong>Salutations</strong></h4>
      <p>A salutation is a greeting at the beginning of an email. You want to make sure it is appropriate for the situation.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>It is safer to be overly formal than too casual.</p>
      <pre><code>  Ex: Dear Mr./Mrs./Dr. _______,
      </code></pre>
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="message-text"><strong>Message Text</strong></h4>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>be clear and concise</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Short and sweet is the best!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <pre><code>  Ex:   I will be absent today. May I please get a study hall pass to go to the library tomorrow, 9/22/19 (wed), during pd. 6?
      </code></pre>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Do not send an email</em></p>
      <ul>
      <li>if the message is too long and complicated, an in person meeting would be more effective.</li>
      <li>if the content is not appropriate.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="closing"><strong>Closing</strong></h4>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>If you are asking for something, end with a “Thank you” to acknowledge you appreciate the reader’s time and help.</p>
      <pre><code>Ex: 
         "Thank you for your time,
             STUDENT NAME"
      </code></pre>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="example-message"><strong>Example Message</strong></h4>
      <pre><code>Subject: Absent from class (9/21/19)   
          Dear Dr. Hall,
              I will be absent today. May I please get a study hall pass to go to the library tomorrow, 9/22/19 (wed), during pd. 6?
          Thank you,
