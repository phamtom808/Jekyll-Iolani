# Jekyll-Iolani

This is a website designed to help self-modivated students with their research.

## Installation

To edit this website, we recommend familiarizing yourself with Jekyll first. You will also need to install Ruby, RubyGems, an IDE, and Git if you haven't already done so. Either pull from the repository or download the zip file to get the source code. From there, use the command "jekyll source" or "jekyll build" in command prompt to generate the website when ready.

## Usage

Navigate to the folder with the code.
dir #lists all files/folders in current directory
cd "path" #changes directory to the new path

Generate website
jekyll source #generatres local version of website
jekyll build #generates website for database/web

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. We ask if you modify the code further to cite UCLA WI+RE and Iolani School as the sources.
